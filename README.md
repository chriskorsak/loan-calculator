## Description

This loan calculator application is a project from [Modern Javascript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning) on Udemy. It notably incorporates javascript DOM manipulation, timeouts, and an animated gif to provide a better user interface experience during the loan calculation.

Additionally, this application uses a CSS framework called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the user interface. This application is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
